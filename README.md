# Palo Alto External Dynamic Lists for Various Services

## Introduction
This provides a number of External Dynamic Lists (EDLs) to be used by a Palo Alto firewall. The following services are supported:

* Microsoft 365.
* Amazon Web Services (AWS).
* Zscaler.
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
* Polycom RealConnect.
* Okta.

The script will use a combination of public APIs and DNS queries to return a list of IP addresses for use in an EDL.

## Requirements
* PHP 7 (will probably work with PHP 5).
* cURL module for PHP.
* Apache 2 with mod_rewrite.
* Make outbound web requests (direct or via a proxy).
* Resolve external FQDNs.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository and move somewhere within the web server's document root.
2. To have requests cached for 24 hours, make the `cache` directory writeable by the web server (e.g. `chown www-data cache && chmod 755 cache`).
3. If you need to use a proxy to connect to external resources from the web server, edit `functions.inc.php`, find the `CURLOPT_PROXY` and `CURLOPT_PROXYPORT` options, uncomment them and set them appropriately.

### Ubuntu 21.04
These instructions will work with a vanilla install of Ubuntu 21.04 Server:
1. Install packages: `apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-php php-curl`
2. Enable Apache and PHP modules: `a2enmod rewrite php7.4 ; phpenmod curl`
3. Edit `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf` and add to the VirtualHost stanza:
````
<Directory "/var/www/html">
  AllowOverride all
</Directory>
````
4. Restart Apache: `systemctl restart apache2`
5. Clone repository in to document root: `cd /var/www/html && git clone https://github.com/david-ramsden/paloalto-edl.git`
6. Enable caching and set proxy, if required (see Installation note #2 and #3 above).

## Updates
Pull the latest code from the repository using `git pull`. This will pull in any new services that get added.

## Usage
Create an External Dynamic List object on the firewall, where the source URL is: `http://your.server/paloalto-edl/<vendor>/<service>`

Note: With PAN-OS 8.1, a source URL using HTTPS was problematic. This was fixed in PAN-OS 9.0 and above.

#### Examples
* `/paloalto-edl/microsoft` will return all IPs and networks for Microsoft 365 services.
* `/paloalto-edl/microsoft/exchange` will return IPs and networks for Microsoft 365 Exchange Online service.
* `/paloalto-edl/aws/ec2` will return all IPs and networks for AWS EC2 globally.
* `/paloalto-edl/aws/s3?region=eu-west-3` will return all IPs and networks for AWS S3 in the eu-west-3 region.
* `/paloalto-edl/gcp` will return all IPs and networks for GCP.
* `/paloalto-edl/gcp?scope=us-central1` will return all IPs and networks for GCP in the us-central1 region.
* `/paloalto-edl/zscaler/hub` will return IPs and networks for Zscaler (zscloud.net) Hub IPs.
* `/paloalto-edl/zscaler/cenr?zscloud=zscaler.net` will return IPs and networks for Zscaler (zscaler.net) CENR IPs.
* `/paloalto-edl/polycom/teams` will return IPs used for outbound calls to Polycom RealConnect service for Microsoft Teams.
* `/paloalto-edl/okta/emea_cell_1` will return IPs used for Production EMEA 1.

#### Notes
* Requests for `microsoft` will only return IPv4 addresses. IPv6 is not requested but this can be changed in the code if required.
* Requests for `aws` and `gcp` will only return IPv4 addresses.
